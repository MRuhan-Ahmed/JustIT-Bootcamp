# Week 6 ‚Äì Python for Data Analysis üêç

In Week 6, we focused on learning Python through hands-on notebook sessions. We covered essential programming concepts like variables, control flow, loops, and functions, and applied the pandas library for real-world data cleaning, filtering, and visualization.

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

- **Day 1: Python Fundamentals**  
  - Jupyter Notebooks, syntax, comments, expressions  
  - Data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans  
  - Variables and basic operations  

- **Day 2: Control Flow & Functions**  
  - `if`, `elif`, `else` statements and nesting  
  - `for` and `while` loops  
  - Loop control: `break`, `continue`  
  - Defined functions with and without arguments  
  - Group activities: temperature classification, ticket pricing logic, number guessing game  

- **Day 3: Data Analysis with Pandas**  
  - Python libraries for data analysis: pandas, matplotlib  
  - Created and manipulated Series and DataFrames  
  - Loaded CSV files, explored data with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`  
  - Filtered data with conditions (`&`, `|`, `==`)  
  - Cleaned data: handling missing values, duplicates, renaming columns  
  - Created new columns with `.apply()`  
  - Aggregated data using `.groupby()`  
  - Plotted bar charts, histograms, scatter plots using pandas + matplotlib

- **Day 4: Visualisation & Practice**  
  - Applied previous concepts in independent and group exercises  
  - Explored patterns using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`  
  - Created final visualisation notebooks using real datasets
