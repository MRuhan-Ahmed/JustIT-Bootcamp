# Week 3 â€“ MySQL & SQL Queries

This week focused on learning SQL for structured databases. I explored JOINs, database design, normalization, and real-world querying.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- **SQL Theory & Practice**:
  - Primary vs secondary keys, foreign keys
  - One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
  - SQL JOIN types: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF

- **Database Design**:
  - Designed a full relational schema for a retail system (products, customers, sales, loyalty)
  - Wrote SQL to:
    - Create tables
    - Add constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, CHECK)
    - Populate tables with `INSERT INTO`

- **SQL Practical Tasks**:
  - Used `world_db` to run real-world queries:
    - Counted cities in the USA
    - Found most populous city and country
    - Queried cities by prefix, population range, and continent
    - Performed grouped aggregations (e.g. average population, GDP per capita)

## ðŸ“„ Files
- `retail_schema.sql`
- `world_db.sql` (practice queries)
- Example outputs from `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and `AGGREGATE` queries

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaway

Developed confidence writing SQL for data analysis and learned how to design and query normalized relational databases.
